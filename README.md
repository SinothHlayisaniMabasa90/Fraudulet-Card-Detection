In this notebook I will try to predict fraud transactions from a given data set. Given that the data is imbalanced, standard metrics for evaluating classification algorithm (such as accuracy) are invalid. I will focus on the following metrics: Sensitivity (true positive rate) and Specificity (true negative rate). Of course, they are dependent on each other, so we want to find optimal trade-off between them. Such trade-off usually depends on the application of the algorithm, and in case of fraud detection I would prefer to see high sensitivity (e.g. given that a transaction is fraud, I want to be able to detect it with high probability).
